description: "This is a compilation of the most common (and not so common) ways of failing while building an organization. From a lousy idea, to really (and we mean really) unsuitable founding team, to just running out of money and everything in the middle. It's a sad story, really, but one necessary so we stop making the same dumb mistakes. Read on, just get some napkins first. More information about this book on https://100ways.doulab.net"

_*Well sh..t. I've failed again...* That may have well be the modern version of what Thomas Edison said to himself in one of his 10,000 failures creating the lightbulb_

To be fair, what he publicly said was: 

> "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work"
>
> --- Thomas A. Edison

This short book intends to be a not-so-formal compilation of the most common ways and reasons why organizations fail. It is by no means intended to be a comprehensive, exhaustive and academic study but rather, _to be brutally honest_, a *collective relief for all us founders out there in the onlineverse* trying to build organizations for a myriad of important, and not so important, reasons.

Let us be blunt, this book in itself is a crowdsourced, collective *experiment* and it will _*never_* be finished. Which is the reason why we have choosen this online format, and this technology (R Markdown) to publish it online and have our readers be part of this experiment. So, if this is of interest to you, carry on to the .
